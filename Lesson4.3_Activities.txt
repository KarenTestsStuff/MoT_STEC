Task: Based on your instincts, think about testing the below login form with two input fields (username and password). Without any structured approach, list potential issues you might find.

Timebox yourself between 10 and 30 minutes.
For each finding, record why it may be a problem in the table below, what could happen, and what might be the outcome.

1. Entering an email or password alone without the other
    - System might (or should) require both together, but it is not specified in the form
    - User cannot log in and may see an error
2. Entering an email with an incorrect password
    - System will not allow the login
    - User cannot log in and should see a specific error as to why
3. Entering an email that does not exist in the System
    - System will not allow the login
    - User could be redirected to create an account instead
4. User enters valid already registered email and password, but clicks create an account instead
    - System might create a duplicate account
    - Could cause errors in logins or just show an error
5. User enters username without email domain present
    - System will not accept an input that is not an email address
    - User cannot log in and may see an error

Task: Retest the same login form using professional testing approaches and techniques you learned from the previous lesson.
Step 1 and 2: Preparation and conducting "testing" to record findings
● List the techniques, heuristics, or mnemonics you plan to use in the table.
● Plan how you will apply them to the login form.
● For each finding, record why it may be a problem in the table below, what could happen, and what might be the outcome.

1. Accessibility with keyboard navigation
    - After loading the page, use only the keyboard to navigate to and between inputs and submit the form
    - if the DOM is not formatted correctly, some inputs or options may be out of order or completely inaccessible by tabbing through the page
    - if the user only has a keyboard, or uses a screen reader to navigate the page, they will be unable to complete the form

2. Multiple Browser Instances Open
    - Open a Chrome browser and a Firefox browser. Log in within Chrome while the login page is open in Firefox. Navigate to the dashboard in Firefox while logged into the Chrome browser
    - if the token does not exist in Firefox, it may tell the user they are not logged in
    - The user may not be able to use Firefox, only the Chrome browser

3. Single Space at end of email
    - Leave a single space after the end of a valid registered email, input correct password, and attempt to submit
    - If the input is not sanitized of white space, the input may be submitted with the trailing space
    - The user may be told their email or password is not accepted

4. Common Delimiters and Special Characters: an apostrophy in a business email
    - Use an email like Karen's_Tests@gmail.com and valid password
    - Some input fields do not allow common special characters, even though it may be a fully valid email address
    - This user would not be able to create an account or log in, hindering access to the application

5. Accented Chars
    - Use an email with an accented letter in a person's name for their email username on a non-English qwerty keyboard
    - Some input fields do not allow common non-English characters, even though it may be a fully valid email address
    - This user would not be able to register or log in, hindering access to the application

Reflect:

How do you feel about the outcomes of structured testing compared to intuitive testing?
    Intuitive testing relies on a personal experience to know what to test for. Structured testing can incorporate other views and heuristics to form a more complete picture of the capabilities and risks

How did preparation influence your focus and effectiveness during testing?
    I was similarly focused for both exercises, although I might have found more testing opportunities using the Cheat Sheet more quickly than trying to sort through my brain on my own

Which structured techniques did you find most valuable, and why?
    I don't know, I had to speculate because there wasn't an actual application to test. Without knowing what is actually happening during the testing, I cannot answer this silly question for real

What would you do differently next time to improve your testing process?
    Test an actual login flow, instead of a static photo of a login screen
