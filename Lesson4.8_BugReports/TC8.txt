Title - Expand/collapse carat marks all items as completed, instead of collapsing the list
    Expected - The carat should not interact with the completeness of the items, only collapse and expand the list
    Reality - Selecting the carat marks all tasks as completed, and only then can the user expand or collapse the list
    Notes - When I clicked the arrow dropdown when only showing "Another todo" completed in the list,
            it automatically marked all todos as completed and showed all in the filtered list
            This also appears to happen when on the "All" filter and having one item marked completed
            The arrow appears to mark all as completed, upon first selection, then selects all as incomplete on second selection
