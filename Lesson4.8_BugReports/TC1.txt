Title - When adding a todo, the counter does not display the correct length
    Expected - The counter should show the correct number of todo's in the list.
    Reality - The counter is off count by -1.
    Notes - One todo is added to the list, but counter shows 0 items left
        Found this in Sources > js > controllers > todoCtrl.js:
        $scope.$watch('todos', function () {
        $scope.remainingCount = $filter('filter')(todos, { completed: false }).length -1
        The length -1 means that the list count will always be 1 item short of real count
