Applying testing techniques: Hands-on webpage testing

https://todolist.james.am/#/
A todo app built like The Evil Tester's application
Timebox - 30 minutes
List 5-10 potential tests to stay focused:
    1. Add a todo
        I expect the todo to be added to the list, and the counter to increase by one
        Finding: Todo is added to the list, but counter shows 0 items left
            Found this in Sources > js > controllers > todoCtrl.js:
            $scope.$watch('todos', function () {
			$scope.remainingCount = $filter('filter')(todos, { completed: false }).length -1
            The length -1 means that the list count will always be 1 item short of real count
        Bug logged TC1.txt
            
    2. Mark a finished todo complete
        I expect the todo to be checked off, marked through, and greyed out
        Finding: Clicking the circle to the left of the todo marks it as completed (checked off, marked through, and greyed out)
            Selecting the "Completed" filtering button shows only this todo

    3. Delete a todo
        I expect a completed todo will be deleted when I select "Clear" button, and the counter should decrease by one
        Finding: Selected "Another todo" as completed, then clicked Clear
            "Another todo" was deleted
            As another example, clicked the "X" to the right of a todo that was not completed
                Todo was deleted

    4. Edit a todo
        I expect that double clicking an active todo will allow me to edit and save it
        Finding: Double clicking an active todo allows edits.
            Deselecting the field saves the newly edited todo

    5. Keyboard navigation
        I expect the application to be accessible by using keyboard functionality only, tabbing through the options
        Finding: Keyboard only navigation only shows focus on the entry field
            Cursor gets lost on the page after moving away from entry field
            Individual todos cannot be interacted with, only the filters
        Bug logged TC5.txt
    
    6. Filtering multiple todos in multiple stages of completeness
        I expect that with two active todos, and two marked completed todos, when I toggle between the filters the correct todos and counts will be displayed
        Finding: The correct todos are displayed, the counters are still off by 1
        See bug logged TC1.txt for counts

    7. Clearing the list when no todos are marked completed
        I expect that no todos will be removed, because they are still active when I select "Clear" button
        Finding: No todos are removed

    8. Collapsing the list with active todos 
        I expect the counter to remain constant, even if the list is collapsed with active todos
        Finding: When I clicked the arrow dropdown when only showing "Another todo" completed in the list,
            it automatically marked all todos as completed and showed all in the filtered list
            This also appears to happen when on the "All" filter and having one item marked completed
            The arrow appears to mark all as completed, upon first selection, then selects all as incomplete on second selection
            When all items are marked completed, the counter shows "-1 items left"

    ADDITIONAL NOTES from testing:
    Spelling error in prompt - "Need's"
    Spelling error in footer "toodo"
    Double clicking a completed todo also allows edits and saves when defocusing the field
    Deleting all items in the list using X causes the prompt in the entry field to disappear
        Refreshing the page renews the prompt text
